TITLE
A 3D Scene Recognition Algorithm Leveraging Point Cloud Saliency
ABSTRACT
Accurate and robust scene recognition is essential for both autonomous vehicles (AVs) and mobile robots (MRs) navigation, yet achieving full pose invariance and high performance across diverse scenes remains challenging. In this work, We propose a three-dimensional (3D) scene recognition algorithm based on point cloud saliency, which describes 3D scenes from a more objective perspective. Firstly, point cloud saliency is utilized to filter out some interfering information. Secondly, saliency coding features are generated by clustering the most salient regions, and multiple global descriptors are generated by scanning around these features. Then, the three degrees of freedom is solved based on the matching of global descriptors of the point cloud and used for subsequent localization tasks. Finally, tests on open-source datasets verify the robustness and accuracy of the proposed 3D scene recognition algorithm.
